### Quick Start

2. Hover briefly or click the control panel handle on the right side of the page to open the sidebar. From the sidebar, you can select session dates, switch views, or filter nodes.
3. Use the status bar to switch views or toggle the visibility of hidden/closed nodes.
4. Click on nodes to view detailed information.

### Sidebar

The sidebar is primarily used for session selection and node filtering:

- View Switching: Switch the current view (Tree Diagram / Waterfall Diagram) from the top of the sidebar
- Session Calendar: Displays sessions by date and allows you to select and load session histories. If multiple sessions exist on the same day, they are displayed individually
- Filtering Controls: Filter results based on navigation types or actions (e.g., show only link clicks, form submissions, etc.)

Tip: The sidebar serves as the main entry point for switching data ranges or identifying analysis scopes. It is recommended to select a session first and then switch views.

### Status Bar

The status bar provides concise context and interactions within the interface:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Tree view: Displays page navigation relationships in a hierarchical structure, clearly showing which page led to the next.
2. Waterfall: Visualizes browsing events along a time axis, useful for seeing overlaps and durations.
=======
- Displays and switches the current view (Tree Diagram / Waterfall Diagram)
- Shows session statistics (e.g., number of nodes, session duration) and provides quick actions related to the view (e.g., toggling the visibility of hidden nodes)
- Click the date to quickly return to today's session
>>>>>>> c007809af331c0fe4fb45e1540565da910dce9a2

Explanation: The controls in the status bar are direct interaction entry points related to the current view. More complex filtering continues to be performed through the sidebar.

### View Interactions

Navigraph provides two complementary views: Tree Diagram and Waterfall Diagram.

#### Tree Diagram

Purpose: Display page navigation paths using hierarchical relationships, making it easy to analyze entry points and branches.

- Node Interaction: Hover to display brief information. Click to open the detail panel (including title, URL, access time, SPA request count, etc.)
- Zoom/Drag: In the Tree view, drag the canvas with the mouse to move it, and use the mouse wheel to scale the view (specific behavior may vary depending on the browser and settings)
- SPA Badge: Tree nodes feature subtle ring badges and numbers (if SPA requests exist) to indicate the number of SPA requests merged into the node.

#### Waterfall Diagram

Purpose: Display events/requests along a timeline, making it easy to identify overlaps and durations.

- Node Interaction: In the Waterfall Diagram, nodes within the same tab and time range are grouped into collapsible groups. Users can expand these groups to view items within. Collapsible groups are typically displayed in a drawer style and support internal scrolling
- Collapsible Groups: Grouped by tab (nodes in the same tab and time range are merged into the same group). After expansion, more items can be scrolled within the drawer
- Wheel and Drag: In the current implementation, the mouse wheel is primarily used to scroll vertically between lanes. Dragging is used to move the time window or adjust the observation window position
- SPA Badge: The mark at the top-right corner of nodes indicates the number of SPA requests merged into the node.

### Options Page (Settings)

The options page includes several preferences for adjusting the extension's behavior:

- Idle time threshold for session splitting (used to automatically split sessions)
- Session mode selection (e.g., daily / manual / activity-based)
- Language selection (used to force the localization language of the interface)

Explanation: Node filtering, visibility control, and more detailed filtering operations are provided by the filtering controls in the sidebar or controls within the view. The options page focuses on global behavior and localization settings.

### Troubleshooting (FAQ)

- View not updating: Refresh the extension page or try reloading the session.
- Session splitting issues: Adjust the idle time threshold in the options page to achieve a split more in line with expectations.

### Visualization Views

Navigraph offers multiple ways to view your browsing history:

1. Tree view: Displays page navigation relationships in a hierarchical structure, clearly showing which page led to the next.
2. Timeline: Shows your browsing history in chronological order, helpful for understanding time distribution.

### Session Management

1. Automatic session division: The system automatically divides your browsing history into different sessions based on your browsing habits and time intervals.
2. Session calendar:
   - Click or hover your mouse to open the control panel on the right
   - Dates with records are marked with special colors
   - Click a date to view sessions for that day and load its browsing history
3. Workday mode: The system organizes sessions based on workdays, making it easy to distinguish between work and leisure browsing activities.

### Filtering

1. Type filtering: Use filtering tools to filter pages by navigation type (direct access, link clicks, form submissions, etc.).
2. Behavior filtering: Use filtering tools to filter pages by navigation behavior.
3. Status filtering: Choose to view only active pages or include closed pages.

### Node Interaction

1. View details:
   - Hover over nodes to display brief page information
   - Click on nodes to view complete page details (title, URL, access time, etc.)
2. Revisit: Click links in the node details panel to reopen the page
3. Node highlighting: Clicking a node highlights other directly related nodes
4. Drag and zoom:
   - Drag the view area to pan the entire chart
   - Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out
   - Use two-finger gestures on touch devices to zoom

### Personalization

1. Theme switching: Switch between light/dark themes in the top toolbar
2. Layout adjustment: Adjust node spacing, connection line styles, and other visual parameters
3. Session settings:
   - Adjust the idle time threshold for automatically creating new sessions
   - Select session mode (daily/manual/activity-based)

### Data Management

1. Local data: All browsing history data is stored only on your device, ensuring privacy.
2. Export functionality: Export browsing history of selected sessions as JSON or CSV formats for data analysis.

### Common Use Cases

1. Find previously visited pages: Even if you've forgotten the URL or title, you can find previously browsed pages through visualization.
2. Analyze browsing habits: Understand your internet habits, frequently visited sites, and typical navigation paths.
3. Work research organization: Review all related pages visited during specific research or work sessions to help organize ideas and materials.

### Troubleshooting

1. View not updating: If current browsing activity is not showing in the graph, try refreshing the extension page.
2. Session identification issues: If session division does not meet expectations, adjust the idle time threshold in settings.
